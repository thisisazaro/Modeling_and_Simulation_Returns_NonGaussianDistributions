# Abstract

It is well known that the probability distribution of high-frequency ﬁnancial 
returns is characterized by a leptokurtic, heavy-tailed shape. This behavior 
undermines the typical assumption of Gaussian log-returns behind the standard 
approach to risk management and option pricing. Yet, there is no consensus on what 
class of probability distributions should be adopted to describe ﬁnancial returns 
and diﬀerent models used in the literature have demonstrated, to varying extent, 
an ability to reproduce empirically observed stylized facts. In order to provide 
some clarity, in this paper we perform a thorough study of the most popular models 
of return distributions as obtained in the empirical analyses of high-frequency ﬁnancial data. 
We compare the statistical properties and simulate the dynamics of non-Gaussian 
ﬁnancial ﬂuctuations by means of Monte Carlo sampling from the diﬀerent models 
in terms of realistic tail exponents. Our ﬁndings show a noticeable consistency 
between the considered return distributions in the modeling of the scaling properties 
of large price changes. We also discuss the convergence rate to the asymptotic 
distributions of the nonGaussian stochastic processes and we study, as a ﬁrst 
example of possible applications, the impact of our results on option pricing 
in comparison with the standard Black and Scholes approach.
